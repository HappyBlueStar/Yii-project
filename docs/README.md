Search
------

Search is implemented based on elasticsearch. For searching accross multiple languages, a set of
different indexes is created.

We also differentiate between indices that are rebuilt completely when docs are generated and indexes that
are update on the fly when data changes.

For each language a different index is created.

All indexed data can be updated using the `./yii search/rebuild` command.
